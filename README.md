### Requirements - Installation:

> This project requires the following being installed on your system:

*   python-requirements
*   geckodriver
*   PhantomJS
*   Firefox

You can install the first three __automatically__ using the `setup.sh` script (_for the time only Linux/Mac OS are supported_) or __manually__ as follows:

To install the _python-requirements_ :

`pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade --user`

But you also need to install:
*   [__Firefox__](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
*   [__PhantomJS__](http://phantomjs.org/)
*   [__Mozilla GeckoDriver__](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

### TODO
- [ ] Add the ability to save the results in csv format (_work in progress_).
- [ ] Provide results in a __json__ format also, so the results be _easily_ used and accessed by other tools.
